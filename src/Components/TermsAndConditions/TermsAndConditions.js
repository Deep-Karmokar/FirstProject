          <h2>The Ticketing Terms</h2>
          <div className="termsText">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Each Ticket you purchase from BCI through a ticketing agent or
                through BCOS is intended to give you a revocable license (or
                right) to entry and attendance of the particular Event only to
                which the Ticket pertains. Each Ticket holder has a right to a
                seat or standing place in relation to the stage, of a value
                corresponding to that stated on the Ticket holderâ€™s Ticket. BCI
                and the Venue reserve the right to provide alternative seats or
                standing place to those specified on the Ticket.
              </li>
              <li>
                A Ticket does not afford the Ticket holder the right to
                transport to the Venue, or parking, or merchandise, or any food
                or beverages at the Venue, unless otherwise stated. Other
                independent service providers might render services relating to
                transport, parking, merchandise, food or beverages at the Venue
                and in such circumstances, the terms and conditions of such
                service providers will apply between it and persons who make use
                of such products or services.
              </li>
              <li>
                You must produce a valid Ticket to gain entry to the Venue and
                you must produce that Ticket for inspection upon request from an
                Event official at any time. Failure to produce such Ticket when
                requested may result in you being denied access to the Venue or
                in you being removed from the Venue.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tickets are not transferable and cannot be resold or offered for
                resale (including on-line auction sites) or used for commercial
                purposes including advertising, competitions, contests,
                sweepstakes, promotions, or used, sold or given away in
                conjunction with other products or services (such as part of a
                travel or hospitality package) without the express written
                permission of BCI in advance. If this condition is breached the
                Ticket may be cancelled without refund or compensation and the
                bearer of the Ticket may be refused entry or removed from the
                Venue.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any Tickets brought from unauthorised agents or third parties
                are not valid and admission to an Event on the strength of such
                Tickets will not be permitted. All Tickets remain the property
                of BCI at all times and constitute a personal revocable license
                from BCI to the Ticket holder which may be withdrawn by BCI and
                admission refused at any time upon refunding the printed
                purchase price of the Ticket.
              </li>
              <li>
                We reserve the right to restrict the sale of Tickets to a
                maximum number per person, per credit card and/or per household
                and to cancel any Tickets purchased in excess of this number.
              </li>
              <li>
                If an error is made in the price of Tickets ordered by you, you
                will be notified by us as soon as possible and we will give you
                the option to either (a) reconfirm your Ticket order at the
                correct price; or (b) cancel your Ticket order and receive a
                full refund from us.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is your responsibility to (i) ensure that your Tickets are
                collected by or delivered to you before the date of the Event;
                (ii) keep your Tickets safe prior to the Event; and (iii) check
                your Tickets and to ascertain the date and the time of the Event
                and if applicable, any rescheduled Event. Event dates and times
                are subject to change. We refer you to the Ticket Purchase
                Agreement which contains detailed provisions relating to the
                collection and delivery of Tickets purchased through BCOS.
                Neither BCI nor BCOS is responsible or liable should you fail to
                obtain your Tickets timeously or for any Tickets that are lost,
                stolen or damaged.
